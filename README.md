# College-Event-Website
Purpose: Allow students to view and interact with events hosted by universities, RSOs (Registered Student Organizations), clubs, and more. Support different user roles with varying permissions (super admin, admin, student).

Project Description Mark 2
Purpose
The purpose of this second draft is to clarify what we have to do for our project. It breaks apart
the document into easier to read sections, and ensures we are on track. In addition,
it provides a section that has a plan of what we need to do, to tackle this project and finish it
early or on-time. Also, used ChatGPT to clarify my original first draft to make it even easier
to read so I'm cross checking what it wrote with what I wrote to make sure everything's
consistent.
